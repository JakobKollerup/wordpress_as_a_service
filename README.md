# Wordpress as a service
## Using clean architecture

The main goal of this program was to make a simple template for using clean architecture in a flutter project.
For this project I used a local docker instance of wordpress, but any wordpress site with a public api will work.

Dependies used for this project:
- get_it - is used to create the IoC container for Dependency Injection
- http - is the http client used
- bloc and flutter_bloc - for the state managment




## Remember to 
```sh
flutter clean
```
and

```sh
flutter pub get
```
